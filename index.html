<br>
<p>Welcome to Cli-Mate! This simple tool data-scrapes all the speeches made in the most recent sitting of the Parliament of Canada, assesses which ones are the most relevant to climate change and 
environmental policy, then aggregates that information for you here. A full dataset is available for the sitting, but if you're in a rush, ChatGPT has put together this handy summary of the day's
events and the various parties' stances:</p>
<br>
<p>The most recent sitting of Parliament occurred on <b>7 October, 2022.</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>Cli-Mate Summary:</b> Bill C-219, titled the "Canadian Environmental Bill of Rights," was introduced by MP Richard Cannings to recognize a federal right to a healthy environment. 
The bill proposed enhancements to  environmental protection by ensuring these rights applied across federal laws and providing mechanisms for individuals to enforce them through legal channels. 
However, it was defeated in December 2023 during the second reading in the House of Commons by a significant margin, with opposition citing concerns about federal overreach into provincial jurisdiction 
and granting courts too much authority over environmental policy. This was the fifth attempt to legislate such a bill federally, continuing efforts over the past decade. Although amendments to the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) in 2023 introduced limited environmental rights, they lacked enforceable remedies, which Bill C-219 sought to address. Despite its failure, advocates argue 
it represents an important push toward a stronger, rights-based approach to environmental legislation in Canada.</p>
